# Enable Code Syntax Highlighting in iA Writer Previews

None of the default preview templates provided by iA Writer support code syntax highlighting. Luckily, a community member has created [a custom template](https://github.com/jhermsmeier/github-math-iatemplate) which enables it. To install the template, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/iainc/iA-Writer-Templates#ios). Unfortunately, the template does not support Dark Mode; luckily, it has already been reported as [an issue](https://github.com/jhermsmeier/github-math-iatemplate/issues/4).
