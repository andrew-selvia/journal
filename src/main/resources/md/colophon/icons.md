# Icons

## Main

The main icon is a stylized "S". Imagine pulling each end of an "S" outward. The "S" pays homage to the primary author's last name: Selvia. The icon itself pays homage to the leaf of the Apple icon. In fact, it was created by obtaining an Apple icon from [official marketing material](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/marketing), extracting just the leaf, flattening one side, duplicating the shape, rotating the duplicate 180 degrees, and finally transposing the duplicate down and to the left until the points of each shape connected. This process was completed using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com).

## Sidebar

The sidebar icon was created by the process described in [*Get SF Symbols in SVG Format*](/md/todo/get-sf-symbols-in-svg-format.md).

## GitHub

The GitHub icon was obtained directly from [GitHub's marketing materials](https://github.com/logos).
