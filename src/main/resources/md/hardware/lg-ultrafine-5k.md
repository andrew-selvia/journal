# LG UltraFine 5K

The LG UltraFine 5K is a good display to pair with your Mac. With its large, high-density screen, it is capable of rendering macOS with aplomb. The following list collects documentation of how to use the display with your Mac:

* [Use multiple displays with your MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210754)
* [Use True Tone on your Mac - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208909): Note that True Tone only works on the UltraFine 5K if your MacBook is open (not in "clamshell" mode); otherwise, the ambient light sensor can't detect the brightness of the room.
