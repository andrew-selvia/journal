# Capture iPhone Screenshots with Consistent Time

A meticulous attention to detail may cause you to desire the marketing screenshots of your iPhone app to use a consistent time. Luckily, this compulsion has a solution:

1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via a cable.
2. On your Mac, open QuickTime.
3. Choose File > New Movie Recording (⌥⌘N).
4. To the right of the record button, select the downward-facing chevron button.
5. Under the Camera section, choose the name of your iPhone.

Observe that the time in the top-left corner of your iPhone now remains at 9:41 ([the time at which the iPhone was announced](https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-14-why-9-41-am-is-the-always-the-time-displayed-on-iphones-and-ipad.html)). Now, whether you need to record a video of your app or simply take screenshots, the time will remain consistent.
