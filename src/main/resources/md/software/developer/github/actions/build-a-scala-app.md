# Build a Scala App

If you're using SBT, you may want to begin by reading through its [documentation of how to integrate with GitHub Actions](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/GitHub-Actions-with-sbt.html). For additional context, read [*Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions for a Scala Project*](https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/05/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-scala-project) which details how to configure [unit tests](https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/05/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-scala-project#unit-tests), [code coverage](https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/05/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-scala-project#code-coverage), [code formatting](https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/05/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-scala-project#code-formatting), and [GitHub Actions](https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/05/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-scala-project#github-actions).

Separately, you may also find the [sbt-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sbt-action) valuable in certain circumstances.
