To configure the amount of memory available to a container, you can specify an amount in the Pod definition.

[This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50805048/6073927) also helps clarify the difference between the two notations for defining a memory amount:

> 1. 5 G = 5000000 KB (5000 MB)
