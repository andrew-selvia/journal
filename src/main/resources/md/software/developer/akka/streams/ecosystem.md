# Ecosystem

There are many projects which enable stream-centric programming models. Choosing the right one depends heavily on the context of the problem you're solving. For instance, you may use Akka Streams when doing general stream processing, Alpakka when ingesting streams from popular services like [Google Cloud Storage](../../return-a-file-stored-in-google-cloud-storage-via-a-play-application.md), or Kafka Streams when ingesting from Kafka. For more details about the stream processing ecosystem, refer to the following videos:
