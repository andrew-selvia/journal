# Swift Cluster Membership

Quoting [*Introducing Swift Cluster Membership*](https://swift.org/blog/swift-cluster-membership/) regarding the newly-announced [swift-cluster-membership](https://github.com/apple/swift-cluster-membership) project: 

> This library aims to help Swift grow in a new space of server applications: clustered multi-node distributed systems. With this library we provide reusable runtime-agnostic membership protocol implementations which can be adopted in various clustering use-cases.

> Cluster membership protocols are a crucial building block for distributed systems, such as computation intensive clusters, schedulers, databases, key-value stores and more.

This is a thrilling development for the Swift on Server community.
