# AST Explorer

You can explore the AST Swift generates for your code using [this web page](https://swift-ast-explorer.kishikawakatsumi.com). The code which powers it is located in the following repos:

* [swift-ast-explorer](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/swift-ast-explorer)
* [swift-ast-explorer-playground](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/swift-ast-explorer-playground)
* [SwiftAST](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/SwiftAST)

Along these lines, it would be neat to see a `NSOutlineView` version of `swift -dump-ast` some day.
