## Scala Plugin

* [*Indentation-based Brace Handling*](https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2020/07/22/intellij-scala-plugin-2020-2-indentation-based-brace-handling): Braces (i.e. `{}`) can be automatically added and removed contextually (i.e. when you expand a single-line method body to multiple lines or vice versa); take care to follow the instructions carefully if you want braces to be removed automatically since that feature is turned off by default.
