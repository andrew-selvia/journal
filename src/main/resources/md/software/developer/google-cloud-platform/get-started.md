# Get Started

The sections below surface a few resources which should help catalyze your journey when getting started with Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Compare Approaches to Serving Websites

When deciding how to serve your website on Google Cloud Platform, you should start by referencing [*Serving Websites*](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-serving-overview). It compares various approaches such as:

* [*Hosting a Static Website*](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-serving-overview)
* [*Using Virtual Machines with Compute Engine*](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-serving-overview#compute-engine)
* [*Using Containers with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)*](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-serving-overview#kubernetes-engine)
* [*Building on a Managed Platform with App Engine*](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-serving-overview#app-engine)

If you are inclined toward a container-based architecture, you may also benefit from reading [this guide to getting started with GKE](google-kubernetes-engine/get-started.md).

## Configure gcloud

While you will almost certainly end up using the GCP Console for some tasks, you should be aware of the `gcloud` application. It is a vital automation tool that you should leverage for anything you do more than once. Additionally, the commands you run with it can be a good source of early documentation. To begin using `gcloud`, follow these guides:

* [*Using the Google Cloud SDK Installer*](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive)
* [*The gcloud Command-line Tool Cheat Sheet](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/cheatsheet)
