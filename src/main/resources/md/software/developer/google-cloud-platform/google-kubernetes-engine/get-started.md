# Get Started

If you are new to Kubernetes, you should probably begin by reading an [overview](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or its [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs). If you are ready to dive in immediately, start by following the guide to [*Configuring Cluster Access for kubectl*](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl).

Once you have installed and configured `kubectl`, you should read [*Deploying a Containerized Web Application*](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app). It documents some critical skills such as how to:

* [Push a Docker image to the Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app#step_3_push_the_docker_image_to)
* [Create a GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app#step_4_create_a_cluster)
* [Deploy a sample app to GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app#step_5_deploy_the_sample_app_to)
* [Expose an app to the Internet via a LoadBalancer](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app#step_6_expose_the_sample_app_to_the_internet)
* [Deploy a new version of an app](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app#step_7_deploy_a_new_version_of_the_sample_app)
