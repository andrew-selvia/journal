# Get Started

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is synonymous with containerization today. It is quickly becoming the industry standard tool for packaging software for distribution across platforms. If you are totally new to containerization, you should read [*Why Docker?*](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) to learn the motivations that have driven the industry toward it. Then, read [*What is a Container?*](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) for a more technical introduction. Once you are ready to start using Docker, follow the [*Docker 101 Tutorial*](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial).
 
As you begin writing your own Dockerfiles, you should reference [*Best Practices for Writing Dockerfiles*](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/). In addition, [*Use Multi-stage Builds*](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) provides useful information about how to optimize your Dockerfiles before deploying them into production.  With the fundamentals mastered, you can proceed to share your images with others on [Docker Hub](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-hub).
