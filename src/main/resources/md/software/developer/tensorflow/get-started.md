# Get Started

When you are starting to use TensorFlow, you will likely need to determine [which versions of TensorFlow, Python, and CUDA are compatible](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations). For optimal training performance, you should also [determine if TensorFlow can access the GPU](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/test/is_gpu_available).
