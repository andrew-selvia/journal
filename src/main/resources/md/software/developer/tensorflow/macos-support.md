# macOS Support

TensorFlow has traditionally only leveraged the CPU on macOS. Obviously, this results in inferior training performance compared to training on a GPU. Luckily, Apple recently announced support for [accelerated training via ML Compute](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/ml-compute-training-on-mac). Now, TensorFlow can leverage the GPU on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
