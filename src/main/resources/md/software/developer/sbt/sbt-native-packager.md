# sbt-native-packager

You can use [sbt-native-packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager) to build binary files which can be executed independently of a local SBT installation. For instance, if you are building a CLI, sbt-native-packager can be used to build the binary file users will execute from their terminals.
