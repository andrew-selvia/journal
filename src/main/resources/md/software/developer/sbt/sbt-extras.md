# sbt-extras

Assuming you have experience with the gradle wrapper pattern by which users can dynamically fetch the Gradle version required to build a project, [sbt-extras](https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras) serves as the equivalent for SBT. This can simplify onboarding since users need not explicitly install and configure a specific SBT version on their own.
