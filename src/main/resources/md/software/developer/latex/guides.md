# Guides

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) is a "document preparation system for high-quality typesetting". Many scientific papers are prepared in LaTeX. For newcomers, it can be a bit intimidating, especially when compared to more consumer-oriented products like Pages or Word. Nonetheless, its technical design and widespread use throughout academic and professional research make it an indispensable technology.

This document centralizes guides for performing specific tasks in LaTeX. Hopefully you can leverage them to complete your documents faster.
