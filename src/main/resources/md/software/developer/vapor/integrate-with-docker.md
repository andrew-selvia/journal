# Integrate with Docker

To build your Vapor app into a Docker image, you should reference [the documentation](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/deploy/docker/#dockerfile). Although, in practice, you may find the Dockerfile produced for [the Hello World project](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/hello-world/) to be a more complete reference.
