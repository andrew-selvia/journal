# Features

## Multiple Carets

All JetBrains IDEs support editing text with multiple cursors. If you ever need to change similarly-patterned text arranged on sequential lines, this feature can save you time. To see it in action, check out [this GIF](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2014/03/intellij-idea-13-1-rc-introduces-sublime-text-style-multiple-selections/). You can also learn more from [the official documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#multiple_cursor).

At a high level, you can leverage this feature by:

* Holding `⌥` then clicking a position at which to place an additional cursor
* Holding `⇧⌥` then dragging to select text and place cursors on each sequential line
* Placing a cursor near a word you want to find, then typing `⌃G` to select the next occurrence of it
* Placing a cursor near a word you want to find, then typing `⌃⌘G` to select all occurrences of it
