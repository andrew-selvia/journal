# Machine Learning

If you are interested in machine learning but don't quite know where to start, some references are assembled below which you may find informative.

## Mathematical Foundations

If you need to brush up on the mathematical foundations underlying the advanced topics in machine learning, check out [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/step-by-step-the-math-behind-neural-networks-d002440227fb). For an even more detailed review, [this textbook](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf) may offer the depth you seek.

## Course

Once you're ready to dive into a course focused on machine learning techniques, [this Caltech lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A) is well-regarded. As you go through it, you may reference its [official homework assignments](https://github.com/tuanavu/caltech-learning-from-data) and [some user-created solutions](https://github.com/ppaquay/Learning-from-Data-Solutions).

## Gradient Descent

This [overview of gradient descent](https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html#gradientdescentvariants) provides theoretical and practical guidance.
