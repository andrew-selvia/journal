# Create a Sidebar

The sidebar on this website pays homage to the design of sidebars in many great applications. For instance, Safari & Xcode both provide sidebars which make navigation of hierarchical data natural. This user interface is so important that it has a dedicated section within the Human Interface Guidelines: [*Outline Views*](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/windows-and-views/outline-views). While [`NSOutlineView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsoutlineview) is a great choice for macOS apps, a website's sidebar must obviously be built upon a different technology stack. Luckily, w3schools.com provides [a tutorial describing how to achieve a similar design using web technologies](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_treeview). The sidebar on this website is directly inspired by that article. Of course, the outline view needs a dedicated sidebar within which to reside. [This demo](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_collapse_sidebar) shows how to build that.

With some effort, you should be able to leverage the two previous articles to produce a rudimentary sidebar. The following list enshrines a few solutions to pesky issues faced during the design of the sidebar on this website:

* The main content slid over the sidebar & navigation bar when the user scrolled until `z-index` was introduced as described in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14137993/6073927).
* When the contents of the outline view in the sidebar exceeded the width of the sidebar, scrolling horizontally did not reveal any new content until the changes described in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/679890/6073927) were implemented.
* When the sidebar was too constrained vertically to render all the contents of the outline view, scrolling vertically did not reveal any new content until the changes described in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36010800/6073927) were implemented.
