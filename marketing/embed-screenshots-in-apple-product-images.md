# Embed Screenshots in Apple Product Images

Whether you're preparing marketing materials for a new app or assembling a Keynote presentation to show off an app's features, you will certainly want to present your app in the best light possible. A professional touch can be achieved by embedding screenshots of your app in Apple's official product images. Apple provides [marketing images](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#section-products) for all its products, including combinations in case your app crosses multiple platforms. You can leverage these as well as the other assets on Apple's [Marketing Resources and Identity Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines) page to demonstrate a higher level of quality to your audience.

## Use Pixelmator to Embed Screenshots in Apple Product Images

One process you can employ to embed screenshots in Apple product images involves using [Pixelmator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104). Since Apple distributes its product images as .psd files and you may be hesitant to subscribe to Adobe Creative Cloud due to its recurring expense, Pixelmator could serve as a replacement since it can open .psd files directly.

Begin by taking screenshots of your app (*Tip*: refer to [*Capture iPhone Screenshots with Consistent Time*](capture-iphone-screenshots-with-consistent-time.md) to enforce a static time across all your screenshots). Then, obtain [product images](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#section-products) of your device. Take caution to use the **exact** model on which you captured the screenshot so the image fits neatly without any scaling in the template.

Once you have the screenshot on your Mac and the product image opened with Pixelmator, open Pixelmator's layers panel via View > Show Layers (⌘2). Now, follow these steps for each screenshot you want to frame:
1. Drag the screenshot to the top of the layers list.
2. Right-click (⌃-click) the screenshot's layer to reveal a menu.
3. Choose Create Clipping Mask.
4. Drag the corners of the screenshot to the edges of the frame until the edges snap to the guides.
5. In the top-right of the window, choose OK.

You should now have a perfectly-framed screenshot of your app. To obtain an image file you can use in other apps:
1. Save the file's contents to an image via File > Save... (⌘S).
2. Select the directory to which the image should be saved.
3. Select the checkbox before Save copy as.
4. Select HEIF (or whichever format fits your needs best; HEIF is a good choice since it minimizes file size, though).
5. Drag the slider to your desired level of quality.
6. Choose Save.

Now, you can use that photo in other apps like Keynote.
