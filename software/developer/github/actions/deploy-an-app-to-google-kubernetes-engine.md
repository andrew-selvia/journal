# Deploy an App to Google Kubernetes Engine

If you want to deploy an app to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) via a GitHub Action, you should start by reviewing the [GKE GitHub Action provided by Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/tree/master/example-workflows/gke). While you're there, you may find other good ideas from the other [example workflows](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/tree/master/example-workflows).
