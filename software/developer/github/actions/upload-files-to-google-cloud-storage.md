# Upload Files to Google Cloud Storage

It is possible to upload files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) via a GitHub Action. [*Automatic Upload to Google Cloud Storage with GitHub Actions*](https://dev.to/bshaw/automatic-upload-to-google-cloud-storage-with-github-actions-mj0) describes in detail the steps required to create the workflow. While following that guide, you may find it helpful to refer to [the code](https://github.com/bshaw/sha.ws/blob/master/.github/workflows/google-cloud-storage.yml). Under the covers, the approach described in the guide uses the [setup-gcloud action](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/tree/master/setup-gcloud). You can browse [other convenient actions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions) provided by Google Cloud Platform such as [upload-cloud-storage](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/tree/master/upload-cloud-storage).
