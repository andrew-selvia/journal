# Digital Gardening

The term "digital gardening" is a nebulous term that represents a movement on the web toward curating content on an independent webpage. It is seemingly correlated with ideas like wikis and personal search engines while offering distinction with respect to more common forms of web writing like blogging, especially as it's done on the web's major platforms.

Ironically, it is a concept which suits the style and format of this journal quite well. Though this journal predates the most recent movement, it is ultimately just a refocused effort to maintain the initial spirit of the web as an independent, distributed network of information. Hopefully, digital gardening will continue to embody that spirit and grow ever more convenient and popular.
