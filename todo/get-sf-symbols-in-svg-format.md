# Get SF Symbols in SVG Format

Apple's [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview) library provides developers with well-designed iconography for use alongside text within their apps. If you would like to use one of the symbols outside of an app on Apple's platform (for instance, on a website), you will need to export it to a more open format. Luckily, the SF Symbols app allows you to export a symbol as a svg file via its **File > Export Symbol...** menu item. You can then open that svg file in an app like Sketch to extract an SVG of the symbol itself.
