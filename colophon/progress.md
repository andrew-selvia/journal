# Progress

One core principle this website aims to follow is "progress, not perfection". As proof, this page highlights some intermediate states in which it has been published. Take a look at some missteps and experiments that have been made along the way:

* Using Base16 themes for syntax highlighting (notice the lack of color diversity for different expression types):

* Using Nord for syntax highlighting (notice the monotonous color palette):

* Rendering the navigation tree as a bullet list:

* Prematurely returning the stream of a file's contents in the service rather than letting it complete (resulting in randomized, potentially incomplete versions of the file being rendered):
